    <h1>Hobbies</h1>

    <h2>Hobby 1</h2>
    <p>As a child, I absolutely loved building with LEGOs. I have a vivid memory of spending an entire weekend building a massive spaceship, only for it to be accidentally be knocked over by my younger sister. It was a tragedy!</p>

    <h2>Hobby 2</h2>
    <p>Another one of my favorite hobbies was drawing. I would spend hours sketching pictures of my favorite cartoon characters. I particularly remember a time when I tried to draw a realistic portrait of my dog and it ended up looking more like a lumpy potato with legs.</p>

    <h1>Toys</h1>

    <h2>Toy 1</h2>
    <p>My favorite toy was a remote control car. I used to race it around the house, creating intricate obstacle courses with pillows and books. One time, I drove it under the couch and it got stuck for a whole week, much to my dismay.</p>

    <h2>Toy 2</h2>
    <p>Another beloved toy was a set of action figures from my favorite superhero show. I would create elaborate storylines for them, having them fight epic battles in the backyard. I remember one particular battle where the main hero had to defeat a villainous squirrel who had stolen all the acorns.</p>
